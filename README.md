# OpenNotepad
### **We finally can have an x64 Notepad binary!**

I just got the source from the Window XP Leak, and made it into a Visual Studio project that can be compiled.

# How to Use
Just download the project files, and open in Visual Studio.

# Disclaimer
I did not create this; Microsoft did. I only changed a bit of the source code so it would compile in Visual Studio.
